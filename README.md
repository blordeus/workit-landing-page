## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Materialize - CSS framework

### What I learned

For this project, I wanted to explore using a CSS framework while also implementing the CSS knowledge that I previously learned. This added another set of challenges since I was unable to fully recreate the design. However, this encouraged me to learn and use other frameworks that will allow me to quickly

Code used to utilize Materialize:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/materialize/1.0.0/css/materialize.min.css">
```

Fonts imported for the project:

``` css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Fraunces';
    src:url('./assets/fonts/fraunces/Fraunces-VariableFont_SOFT\,WONK\,opsz\,wght.ttf');
  }

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Manrope';
    src: url('./assets/fonts/manrope/Manrope-VariableFont_wght.ttf');
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on how to better implement frameworks for future projects. When researching which framework to use, I enjoyed reading about the many features and tools they offer to the developer. I believe having a better understanging of frameworks will assist with some of the more tedious aspects of coding.
